This is a small game that has multiple game modes.

1) Multiplayer: which allows you to play against someone else.
2) Solo Easy: mimics a new player so the choices are randomly made.
3) Solo Medium: mimics an experienced player which will block some of the know strategies and prioritizes completing the row and then blocking the player.
4) Solo Impossible: mimics an expert where all commonly known strategies are blocked and completion of rows and blocking the player is prioritized.
