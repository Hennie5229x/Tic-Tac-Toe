This is a small game that has multiple game modes.

### 1) Multiplayer: 
        Which allows you to play against someone else.
### 2) Solo Easy: 
        Mimics a new player so the choices are randomly made.
### 3) Solo Medium: 
        Mimics an experienced player which will block some of the know strategies and prioritizes completing the row and then blocking the player.      
### 4) Solo Impossible: 
        Mimics an expert where all commonly known strategies are blocked and completion of rows and blocking the player is prioritized. (Not actually impossible)
